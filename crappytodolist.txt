roughly in order of importance
==============================

* entity component thing
 - merge ui system into entity system (ui nodes)

* asset management system
 - textures
 - fonts
 - sounds
 - custom import classes you can create (::ext?)
   - e.g: TiledMapImporter : lev::AssetImporter<TiledMap> { public: TiledMap load(const char* file) override; } ...

* add much more asseritions where theyre needed

* theres no fixed framerate currently lol actually make that a thing

* get rid of some of the Ref<T> and see if you can replace them with raw pointers

* spritebatch instanced rendering

* sounds / music

* quaternion implementation

* string class (just using std::string for now)
