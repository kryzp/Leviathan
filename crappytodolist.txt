roughly in order of importance
==============================

* asset management system
 - textures
 - fonts
 - sounds
 - custom import classes you can create (::ext?)
   - e.g: TiledMapImporter : lev::AssetImporter<TiledMap> { public: TiledMap load(const char* file) override; } ...

* font string_width and string_height functions

* unbind functions in the rendering pipeline

* add much more asseritions where theyre needed

* theres no fixed framerate currently lol actually make that a thing

* get rid of some of the Ref<T> and see if you can replace them with raw pointers

* spritebatch instanced rendering

* sounds / music

* quaternion implementation

* string class (just using std::string for now)

* debuggging console

* lua???

* quads are like upside down lol makes it hard to work with
