ill just dump some single header "extensions" for leviathan here, which
will let you just drag and drop them into a project and then just use 'em.

-> theyll only use the leviathan lib and nothing else so by including one you dont end up including the rest of time and space aswell
   -> and if they did it'd be in a case like a TiledMap renderer extension needing to also have a TiledMap parser/asset extension

examples include:
 * gaussian blur
 * physics extensions
 * rendering extensions
 * extra entity 'components'
 * support for more file types / parsing into usable assets (e.g: `Tiled` maps, `Aseprite` files)
