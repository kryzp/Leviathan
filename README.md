lightweight-ish game engine

(this is my first attempt at a proper game engine)

this is mainly just a demonstration of what i can do
but also probably something ill make use of when doing my own projects

note to anyone who actually wants to use this: the structure of this engine changes all of the time! which means your project could easily (probably will) break if you update. im not responsible for any damages that may cause.
