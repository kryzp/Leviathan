# Leviathan
lightweight-ish game engine

this isn't really meant to be used on its own, i encourage you to *heavily* modify this when using it in your own projects

note to anyone who actually wants to use this: the structure of this engine changes all of the time! which means your project could easily (probably will) break if you update. im not responsible for any damages that may cause.
