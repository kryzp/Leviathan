# Leviathan
game engine thingy  
i want this to be an opengl + sdl2 game engine  
  
do i know opengl? no but i hope to learn it by the time i finish this  
do i know sdl2? half/half  
  
oh and by the way i spent an embarrassing amount of time thinking about what it should be called. still not happy with the name... i went from Dawnbreakr to BBB to QuickFire to Luminous to a name i cant remember now to Leviathan...

ive always wanted a personal game engine in c++. every game engine i use is alright but its always just a little awkward haha. monogame is good but im not a fan of the content manager as its clunky imo and the libraries you can install to it (Monogame.Extended, Nez, ...) always seemed a little too much (not that thats monogames fault just something that irks me). like i want tiled integration but not half the entire library to come with that :/. maybe its just me but i find comfort in doing everything from scratch?
