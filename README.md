lightweight-ish game engine(?). (similar to monogame if you've ever used it, albeit less optimized and missing some features)

note to anyone who actually wants to use this: the structure of this engine changes all of the time! which means your project could easily (probably will) break if you update. im not responsible for any damages that may cause.
